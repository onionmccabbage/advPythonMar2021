Advanced Python Review 2
========================
In a new package, write modules to implement a weather service
You can use the following end-point to get the current weather (as JSON):
http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=athlone,ie&units=metric&APPID=48f2d5e18b0d2bc50519b58cce6409f1

Remember to import requests

In your code, ask the user to input a city and a country (athlone and ie above) and inject them into the url
Validate that they entered a non-empty string for city, and 2 or 3 letters for country

Make a 'get' request to the 'openweathermap' API, using the city and country values entered by the user
Convert the response text from JSON into a Python structure
Print the weather description, temperature, wind-speed and wind-direction
  e.g. if your returned data structure is called 'weather', do something like this: 
	desc = weather['weather'][0]['description']
    	temp = weather['main']['temp']
   	wspd = weather['wind']['speed']
    	wdir = weather['wind']['deg']

For every successful weather request, append the results to a file (either json.dumps or pickle.dumps)

Optional:
Write a custom generator which yields city/country pairs
Usse this generator to make weather requests for the next city/country pair

Write these 'city, country' values into a text file:
'''Athlone,ie
Galway,ie
Hull,uk
Canberra,aus
Berlin,de
Mardrid,es'''
Read in these city/country pairs and for each make a request for the current weather

Initialise a weather database with a table and a few data members (e.g. date, city, country, description and temperature)
For every weather report put the results into the database, including a date-time of when you created the report
Provide a way to read back all the weather reports
